# Title

Battleship game

# Description

In order to validate my Scala module in class, I had to make a battleship game.
This game had to be implemented in Scala without loops and with only pure functions.
The game can be played in 5 modes :
- Player vs Player
- Player vs AI Beginner
- Player vs AI Medium
- Player vs AI Hard
- Fight of the AI

We had to create 3 levels of AI, with difficulties of low, medium and high.
