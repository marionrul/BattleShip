# Title

Battleship game

# Description

In order to validate my Scala module in class, I had to make a battleship game.
This game had to be implemented in Scala without loops and with only pure functions.
The game can be played in 3 modes :
- Player vs Player
- Player vs Player
- IA vs IA

We had to create 3 levels of IA, with difficulties of low, medium and high.
